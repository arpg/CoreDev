This repository includes libraries for basic development. It is composed of:

* GLConsole, Pangolin & SceneGraph: GUI libraries.
* Calibu: Library with common vision functions and camera calibration.
* HAL: Drivers library for common devices (Cameras, IMUs).

CHECKOUT
---------
To checkout the full repo and it's submodules, type:

$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/arpg/CoreDev.git

If you have already cloned the repo without the --recursive option, you must
retrieve the submodules seperately. Execute:

$ cd CoreDev
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

DEPENDENCIES
-------------
The following are the dependencies REQUIRED to build these libraries:
* GCC Compiler 4.8 (or preferably CLANG)
* CMake (minimum version 3.0)
* OpenGL (ie. Freeglut)
* GLEW
* Eigen3 (minimum version 3.2)
* OpenCV (minimum version 2.4)

Most of these libraries can be installed easily via package managers. For example, in MacOS just do "sudo port install opencv". For Ubuntu, since the repositories are usually out of date, you would have to find and install the required versions manually.

Optional Packages:
* OpenNI (for Kinect driver)
* Avin2 branch (for Kinect driver)
* PrimeSense module (for Asus Xtion Live driver)
* DC1394 (for Bumblebee and certain PointGrey cameras)

COMPILING / INSTALLING
----------------------- 
The libraries can be built together using the provided cmake script or independently from within their own folders.
To build all the libraries, cd into the CoreDev directory and create a build folder for compilation:

$ cd CoreDev
$ mkdir Build
$ cd Build
$ ccmake ..

If you receive error messages at this stage, you may need to satisfy further depencies (as listed above).
Once configuration is complete, launch the build with:

$ make -j


EXAMPLES
-----------
Both Pangolin and SceneGraph include example applications. Included is also a
basic application that uses all 3 libraries: the application will open a camera
and display it on the screen.

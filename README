This repository includes libraries for basic development. It is composed of:

* GLConsole, Pangolin & SceneGraph: GUI libraries.
* Calibu: Library with common vision functions and camera calibration.
* RPG: Drivers library for common devices (Cameras, IMUs).

CHECKOUT
-------------
To checkout the full repo and it's submodules, type:

$ git clone --recursive http://robotics.gwu.edu/git/CoreDev

If you have already cloned the repo without the --recursive option, you must
retrieve the submodules seperately. Execute:

$ cd CoreDev
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

DEPENDENCIES
-------------
The following are the dependencies required to build these libraries:
* OpenGL (ie. Freeglut)
* GLEW
* Eigen3
* OpenCV

Most of these libraries can be installed easily via package managers (ie. "sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev" for Ubuntu, "sudo port install opencv" for MacOS).

Optional Packages:
* OpenNI (for Kinect driver)
* Avin2 branch (for Kinect driver)
* PrimeSense module (for Asus Xtion Live driver)
* DC1394 (for Bumblebee and certain PointGrey cameras)

COMPILING / INSTALLING
----------- 
The libraries can be built together using the provided cmake script or independently from within their own folders.
To build all the libraries, cd into the CoreDev directory and create a build folder for compilation:

$ cd CoreDev
$ mkdir Build
$ cd Build
$ ccmake ..

If you receive error messages at this stage, you may need to satisfy further depencies (as listed above).
Once configuration is complete, launch the build with:

$ make -j


EXAMPLES
-----------
Both Pangolin and SceneGraph include example applications. Included is also a basic application that uses all 3 libraries: the application will open a camera and display it on the screen.
